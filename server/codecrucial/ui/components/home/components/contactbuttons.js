			Hi there, friend. My name's Taylor Dobson and I'm a software developer. I've worked for a few companies, big and small, and always find myself discovering something new to love about the game. This website's just for me to list out some of what I do or have done as well as some of what I hope to accomplish one day. Also, if you haven't noticed yet, I like animations. A lot. If you don't like animations, just click the button at the top right of the screen.
